# TODO App Design Q&A

---

**Q1: What features do you want your TODO app to support?**

A: Adding, deleting, and updating tasks

---

**Q2: Do you want to support marking tasks as completed or incomplete?**

A: Yes, as well as in progress

---

**Q3: Should each task have a due date or deadline?**

A: Yes

---

**Q4: Do you want to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, etc.)?**

A: No

---

**Q5: Should tasks be stored locally in the browser, or do you want to sync them across devices (e.g., using a backend)?**

A: Storing them locally is fine, they don't need to save between refreshes or anything

---

**Q6: What information should each task contain (e.g., title, description, status, due date)?**

A: Title, description, status, and due date seems perfect

---

**Q7: Do you want any sorting or filtering options for the task list (e.g., by due date, status)?**

A: Yes

---

**Q8: What kind of user interface do you prefer (e.g., simple list, cards, modal dialogs for editing)?**

A: A simple list with checkboxes to mark as complete

---

**Q9: Do you want to allow editing tasks inline, or should editing require a separate form or dialog?**

A: Editing inline would be great

---

**Q10: Would you like to add any visual indicators for overdue tasks (e.g., color change, icon)?**

A: Please add an icon for each task. If it's overdue, the icon should be red or something and represent that.

---

**Q11: Do you want to support bulk actions (e.g., delete multiple tasks at once)?**

A: No

---

**Q12: Would you like to add any accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support)?**

A: Yes

---

**Q13: Is there any specific visual style or theme you prefer (e.g., light, dark, colorful)?**

A: I would love pastel themes, with a media query for dark mode.

---

**Q14: Is there anything else you'd like your TODO app to do or any other preferences?**

A: No

End of design Q&A. Ready to proceed to implementation.

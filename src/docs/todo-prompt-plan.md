# TODO CLI Application Prompt Plan

This plan breaks down the development of the TODO CLI app into small, testable steps. Each step includes a goal, a suggested prompt, and notes.

---

## Step 1: Define Task Data Model

**Goal:**  
Create a TypeScript interface for a Task (name, description, due date) and basic validation.

**Prompt:**  
"Define a TypeScript interface for a Task with name, description, and due date fields. Add a function to validate a Task object."

**Notes:**  
- Write unit tests for the validation function.

---

## Step 2: Implement Local Storage

**Goal:**  
Implement functions to load and save tasks from a local JSON file.

**Prompt:**  
"Implement functions to load and save an array of Task objects to a local JSON file. Write tests for these functions."

**Notes:**  
- Ensure file is created if it does not exist.
- Add documentation comments.

---

## Step 3: Add Task Functionality

**Goal:**  
Implement a function to add a new task.

**Prompt:**  
"Add a function to add a new Task to the list and save it. Validate the task before saving. Write tests for this function."

---

## Step 4: Delete Task Functionality

**Goal:**  
Implement a function to delete a task by its ID or name.

**Prompt:**  
"Add a function to delete a Task by ID or name. Write tests for deleting tasks."

---

## Step 5: List Tasks Sorted by Due Date

**Goal:**  
Implement a function to list all tasks, sorted by due date.

**Prompt:**  
"Add a function to list all tasks, sorted by due date. Write tests to verify sorting."

---

## Step 6: CLI Command Parsing

**Goal:**  
Implement command-line parsing for add, delete, and list commands.

**Prompt:**  
"Implement CLI command parsing for add, delete, and list commands using process.argv. Add usage documentation."

---

## Step 7: Table Output Formatting

**Goal:**  
Display tasks in a table format in the CLI.

**Prompt:**  
"Format the output of the list command as a table. Add a test for the table formatting function."

---

## Step 8: Documentation

**Goal:**  
Document usage and developer instructions.

**Prompt:**  
"Write a README.md with usage instructions, command examples, and development notes."

---

## Step 9: Final Testing

**Goal:**  
Test the application end-to-end and fix any issues.

**Prompt:**  
"Write and run end-to-end tests for the CLI app. Fix any bugs found."
